## About Me

Hi! I'm an independent Smart Contract Security Researcher, currently active in competitive audits on platforms like [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/u/Kemah). I'm passionate about improving the security of Web3 by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in blockchain protocols.

For collaborations or audit requests, feel free to reach out on X (formerly Twitter) [@0xKemah](https://x.com/0xKemah).
